# Implementation of FTP client and server


This computer network project implements a File Transfer Protocol(FTP) over TCP/IP using Python language. It consists of a client and a server, where the client/user can upload files to the server and download files from it. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you an idea of the project and how to run it on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.11

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.

## Running the Server and Client code:

To run the server, navigate to the project directory and run these commands in your command prompt:

python3 server.py

(The server will listen on port 4056 by default.)

To run the client side, navigate to the project directory and run these commands in a new command prompt window:
 1) python3 client.py
 2) ftpclient <port_number>
 3) Then you can use "upload file_name" to upload the file to the server and "get file_name" to download the file from the server.
